## Hi, I'm John Conner 😁
I'm a first-year Computer Science student at Brunel University London. Coding is my passion, and I aspire to become a software engineer. My main goal is to be able to create a positive impact on how people connect with software. I'm always open to diverse tech experiences such as events, and always believe that technology should be accessible to everyone regardless of differences. <br> <br>
